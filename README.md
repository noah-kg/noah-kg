## Welcome to my GitHub! ðŸ˜€

**noah-kg/noah-kg** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

My name is Noah Gampe! This GitHub will serve as my project portfolio for my aspiring career as a Data Analyst/Scientist. I hope you will find my projects easy-to-understand, aesthetically pleasing, and curiously interesting. I had a lot of fun putting them together! I performed extensive research and gone down multiple rabbit holes on numerous topics to fully understand what goes into a data science project.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on putting my Data portfolio together!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning as much as I can about Data Analytics, Data Science, & Machine Learning!
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any curious passion projects that might benefit from my skills!
